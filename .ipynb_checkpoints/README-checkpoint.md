# Unit 11 Collections

This homework had two parts.

## Resampling

This assignment focused on using various Resampling methods.  After running the following methods:

    * Oversampling
    * SMOTE
    * Undersampling
    * Combination of Over/Undersampling with SMOTEEN
    
We were able to run logistic regressions on each of Resampling methods and score our results. 

## Ensemble Learning

The second part of the assignme was focused on using two different ensemble algorithms  to test our results for credit risk.

    * BalancedRandomForestClassifier
    * EasyEnsembleClassifier
    
Using the importances method we were also able to identify the primary features.
